Plus, Square integrates with accounting software like QuickBooks and Xero, making back-office management seamless. When can I access my money? You can get instant access to your Square sales with Square Checking. Square Checking is great for contractor management because it gives you more control of your cash flow so you can provide better customer service and run your business efficiently. With Square, you can access funds as soon as the next business day or instantly with Square Checking. Fast payment processing ensures that you won’t have to wait long to access funds from completed jobs.
