How we built instant payouts with Lyft Challenge Lyft’s biggest request from drivers was the ability to get paid more frequently compared to traditional weekly payouts, which meant Lyft needed to find a way to seamlessly pay out drivers at their convenience. Solution Lyft worked with Stripe to build Express Pay, providing drivers the ability to decide when they want to get paid out – typically within a few hours of a journey. Products Connect Payments Today Payments ₹342.00 Rides 12 Time 4h 19m Balance ₹342.00 Get paid Payout activity Power Zones 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM 10:00 PM - 12:00 AM View schedule Ride History 24 Nov, 4:30 PM ₹8.35 4.20 mi • 9m 51s Lyft Home Earnings Referrals How we built multi-party payments with Instacart Challenge Instacart facilitates a multi-sided marketplace with complex payment needs. Instacart needed a way to streamline payments and payouts across consumers, grocery stores, shoppers and delivery partners. Solution Stripe enabled all aspects of Instacart’s intricate payments infrastructure to function at scale, making it easy for customers to pay the way they want, and using features such as Instant Checkout to speed up payouts to shoppers and retailers. Products Payments Connect Instant Cashout ₹150.00 Tips are paid with your weekly deposit Available amount ₹150.00 Transaction fee ₹0.50 Transfer amount ₹149.50 0033 Edit Transfers typically take only a few minutes but it may take up to 24 hours depending on your bank. Confirm cashout How we built embedded finance with Shopify Challenge Dealing with banking and financial services is an essential part of running a business, yet most of today’s banking services aren’t designed for the needs of Shopify’s independent business owners. Solution Shopify built Shopify Balance using Stripe Treasury to offer Shopify merchants a fast, simple and integrated way to obtain critical financial products and oversee their finances – all within Shopify. Products Treasury Payments Connect Issuing Stripe Treasury gives us the flexibility to customise Shopify Balance specifically for our merchants. By building across Stripe’s payments and banking infrastructure, we’ve been able to give Shopify merchants access to critical financial products that meet their needs, such as faster access to funds and rewards, helping them further grow their businesses. Tui Allen , Senior Lead of Banking Services Shopify logo How we launched Stripe Climate with Flexport Challenge To prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change, we need to radically reduce the new emissions we put into the air, and develop new carbon removal technologies to remove carbon already in the atmosphere. Solution Stripe partnered with forward-thinking businesses such as Flexport to launch Stripe Climate, which makes it easy for businesses to contribute a fraction of revenue to fund frontier carbon removal technology. So far, more than two thousand businesses have purchased frontier carbon removal with Stripe Climate. Products Climate Radar Payments Issuing There’s huge potential for Stripe Climate to drive meaningful change in protecting the environment. We're excited to be part of it and to help unlock new solutions to humanitarian and environmental issues.

Stripe: Jobs Stripe logo Jobs Our opportunity Life at Stripe Benefits University See open roles Open mobile navigation Jobs Our opportunity Life at Stripe Benefits University See open roles Close mobile navigation Our customers are building the future Stripe builds financial infrastructure that ambitious companies use to launch their boldest products. Our customers range from hours-old startups to complex global businesses. Collectively, they are growing the GDP of the internet. You can help. See open roles Hear from our leadership Watch video Impact Who do you want to serve in your career? Our customers operate in almost every industry and country. They feed communities, provide healthcare, and help people get around. They run shops, gyms, churches, and they build tools for helping others run them too. They’re selling from their front rooms, and managing global enterprises. And they rely on the infrastructure we build. Stripe processed $641 billion in payments in 2021. We have been entrusted with a significant portion of the global economy, and we need to continue to be reliable stewards of that trust. What matters to us is what we enable for others We focus on the details of everything we do, so businesses around the world can focus on what’s most important to them. So Ford can focus on building a global digital dealership , rather than processing payments. So Le Monde can expand its digital offering globally , not reinvent subscription billing. So truckers can focus on getting supply chains moving , not invoicing paper trails. We take pride in freeing up others to work in the spotlight.

But beneath the surface they’re in constant motion, critiquing their own performance, setting new goals, and continually reevaluating the most basic assumptions about how they approach their work. We’re still in the early stages of our growth and many of our biggest challenges lie ahead. You might think that Stripe has things figured out. While we’re proud of what we’ve built so far, we spend our time thinking about everything we haven’t done yet. We have to be extremely selective in what we do Planning means sacrifice: we have great ambitions but limited resources over short time horizons. We are happy that we can support more than 50 payment methods (and accelerate rollout of new ones), incorporate more than 20,000 startups , and galvanize responses to climate change .

This motivates us to bring in people like you – people who have knowledge and experiences we don’t, and who can quickly bring their talents to bear on hard problems. Stripe is not a pay-your-dues culture; we will train you quickly and then give you substantial responsibility. We often have surprisingly small teams accomplish strikingly important work. The pace of change and velocity of the product force you to pick up new skills, experiment with new tactics, and walk in a variety of users’ shoes. Krithika Muthukumar , Marketing We need to balance speed with meticulousness We have to be able to build things quickly to support the fastest growing startups and platforms in the world, while also being reliable, trustworthy, and sometimes profoundly boring. We need to get projects done today, while building infrastructure that the internet will rely upon for decades . We also need to balance an intense work environment against the need to support fulfilling and sustainable careers. 9 min read Stripe: Platform of Platforms Read on stratechery.com 10 min read Stripe: Thinking Like a Civilisation Read on readthegeneralist.com 10 min read What Working At Stripe Has Been Like Read on kalzumeus.com Experience The right people don’t always think they’re right Successful Stripes are rigorous thinkers who appreciate that things worth doing are rarely simple. We want people who are not afraid to be wrong, who can enthusiastically back proposals they initially opposed, and who know how to support decisions with numbers and narrative. We operate in situations of substantial uncertainty and cannot afford either timidity or recklessness. The global financial system can seem like a mystifying domain . It is not. It is composed of people and computers, just like many other systems you’ve worked on. Most Stripes don’t have a background in finance, and they’ve thrived here because they bring fresh perspectives. We want generalists capable of parachuting anywhere into our operations, learning about a field they have never touched before, and executing competently in areas far outside their formal remit. We also want specialists who are already experts and want to spend several years advancing the state of the art in their fields. We know that we cannot be successful without nurturing the careers of both generalists and the experts. People who thrive in high-conflict work environments often do not enjoy the experience here. We try to embrace kindness while still encouraging Stripes to take measured risks and act boldly, even in the absence of consensus. Worldview Working for the world, across the world Stripe is a team, not a place. We have two headquarters (San Francisco and Dublin), but we belong to the internet. We speak more than 30 languages with our customers and even more with our families. Where we are More than 8,000 Stripes build products and support our users from offices in Amsterdam, Bangalore, Barcelona, Berlin, Chicago, Dubai, Dublin, Hyderabad, London, Melbourne, Mexico City, New York, Paris, Prague, São Paulo, San Francisco, Singapore, Stockholm, Sydney, Tallinn, Tokyo, Toronto, Warsaw, and Zurich—as well as all the homes and coworking spaces of our remote colleagues . Where we need to be We aspire to make internet payments as ubiquitous and effortless as email. This isn’t simply a matter of ignoring borders; it also requires respectful dialogue with governments, embracing cultural differences, and building products that work in local contexts. That’s why we try to be physically close to our users, too. We want to share cabs with them in Singapore and buy food together in the darshinis of Bangalore. Where we’re improving We are grappling with the challenges of operating at an organisational scale that few tech companies reach. We care about our culture and want to preserve the important parts while evolving to meet the needs of new Stripes and our changing business context. StripeSat We continuously listen to our employees to understand where Stripe truly excels and listen for opportunities to further enhance the way we work as a company and as individuals. Mission I can see the relationship between what I do and the overall mission and priorities of Stripe Team connection I feel connected to my team Belief in Stripe Stripe is in a position to be successful over the next three years Remote enablement My location is not a barrier to me having an impact at Stripe Favourable Neutral Unfavourable Community Support to do your best work Many companies can offer you attractive benefits and compensation. We offer that plus something a bit rarer: the opportunity to work with speed and agility on a platform that has an impact across the entire internet. Training and mentorship When you start at Stripe you will go through at least two weeks of in-depth onboarding. We will pair you with experienced team members to show you the ropes. And then you learn by doing. It is common for Stripes to work on things outside their domain of expertise, so we encourage people to regularly attend hands-on classes led by internal and external experts on everything from Learning to Code to Thinking Like a Lawyer. 33 min podcast SaaStr Podcast: Claire Hughes Johnson, COO @ Stripe Listen on saastr.com 4 min read How Stripe teaches employees to code Read on stripe.com/blog Q Kuhns, Internal Communications Before joining the Internal Communications team at Stripe, I headed up a forensic anthropology lab.

Heterogenous perspectives Stripes come from all sorts of professional backgrounds like engineering, design, operations, consulting, government, finance, healthcare, and education. We strive for humility as individuals and as an organisation. We know that we can do great things alone, but even greater things together. We have a transparent internal culture. If you are curious about engineering, running startups, corporate strategy, or the global economy, you’ll have experts to learn from. And they’ll be eager to learn from you. Ownership and impact There is no magic to working with banking partners in Japan, moving billions of dollars around the world, or pushing the limits of browser animations on our product pages. We have smart people who sweat the details – who start with a blank screen, work until a product is ready, and polish until it is exceptional. You will be able to point to specific, high-impact things that didn’t exist until you created them. Everyone at Stripe thinks about creating the best user experience first, then works backward from there. Dave Wright , Design We want to talk to you You came to this page for a reason.

Learn more Watershed logo CEEZER logo Patch logo Terraset logo If you can make a multi-year, multi-million dollar commitment to buying carbon removal, consider joining Frontier as a member. You can also make a one-time contribution . The case for funding carbon removal Carbon removal is critical to counteract climate change To prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change, we should aim to limit global average temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, which corresponds to reducing global annual CO₂ emissions from about 40 gigatons per year as of 2018, to net zero by 2050. To accomplish this, the world will likely need to both radically reduce the new emissions we put into the air, and remove carbon already in the atmosphere. Path to limit global temperature increase to ~1.5°C Limit global temperatures increase to: ~1.5°C ~2°C ~3°C (current path) Historical emissions ~2°C path ~1.5°C path Current path Carbon removal needed to limit global temperature increase to ~1.5°C. Net CO₂ emission (GTCO₂/yr) Year Carbon removal Carbon emissions Current path If we continue current trends, 3 our net carbon emissions will result in a global temperature increase of around 3°C Carbon removal needed to limit global temperature increase to ~2°C Carbon removal needed to limit global temperature increase to ~1.5°C Historical emissions via Global Carbon Project, 1 "Current path" shows SSP4-6.0, 2,3 removal pathways adapted from CICERO. 4 For simplicity this chart only shows CO₂, though the modelled scenarios account for other greenhouse gas emissions, all of which will need to be reduced. However, carbon removal is behind Existing carbon removal solutions such as reforestation and soil carbon sequestration are important, but they alone are unlikely to scale to the size of the problem . New carbon removal technologies need to be developed – ones that have the potential to be high volume and low cost by 2050 – even if they aren’t yet mature. Today, carbon removal solutions face a chicken-and-egg problem. As early technologies, they’re more expensive, so don’t attract a critical mass of customers. But without wider adoption, they can’t scale production to become cheaper . Early adopters can change the course of carbon removal Early purchasers can help new carbon removal technologies get down the cost curve and up the volume curve. Experience with manufacturing learning and experience curves has shown repeatedly that deployment and scale beget improvement, a phenomenon seen across DNA sequencing, hard drive capacity, and solar panels. This thinking shaped Stripe’s initial purchases and ultimately led us to launch Frontier , an advance market commitment (AMC) to buy carbon removal. The goal is to send a strong demand signal to researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors that there is a growing market for these technologies. We’re optimistic that we can shift the trajectory of the industry and increase the likelihood the world has the portfolio of solutions needed to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Experience curves Unit price Time Carbon removal has the potential to follow a similar trajectory with the help of early adopters Hard drives Solar panels DNA sequencing Stylised representation of experience curves from the Santa Fe Institute. 5 How we find and fund Our portfolio and scientific reviewers All purchases are facilitated by Frontier , an advance market commitment to buy $1B+ of permanent carbon removal by 2030.

Pathway Enhanced weathering Track Offtake Deep dive Over geologic timescales, CO₂ chemically binds to minerals and permanently turns to stone. Heirloom is building a direct air capture solution that accelerates this process to absorb CO₂ from the ambient air in days rather than years, and then extracts the CO₂ to be stored permanently underground. Pathway Direct air capture Track Offtake Deep dive CarbonCapture ’s direct air capture machines use solid sorbents that soak up atmospheric CO₂ and release concentrated CO₂ when heated. CarbonCapture’s core innovation is making the capture system modular and upgradeable so that they can swap in best-in-class sorbents as they become available. The captured CO₂ stream is then stored permanently underground.

In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Stripe’s servers (these are rare). Some 4xx errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., a card is declined ) include an error code that briefly explains the error reported. Attributes code nullable string For some errors that could be handled programmatically, a short string indicating the error code reported. decline _ code nullable string For card errors resulting from a card issuer decline, a short string indicating the card issuer’s reason for the decline if they provide one. message nullable string A human-readable message providing more details about the error. For card errors, these messages can be shown to your users. param nullable string If the error is parameter-specific, the parameter related to the error. For example, you can use this to display a message near the correct form field. payment _ intent nullable object The PaymentIntent object for errors returned on a request involving a PaymentIntent. type enum The type of error returned. One of api _ error , card _ error , idempotency _ error , or invalid _ request _ error Possible enum values api _ error card _ error idempotency _ error invalid _ request _ error More Expand all advice _ code nullable string charge nullable string doc _ url nullable string network _ advice _ code nullable string network _ decline _ code nullable string payment _ method nullable object payment _ method _ type nullable string request _ log _ url nullable string setup _ intent nullable object source nullable object HTTP Status Code Summary 200 OK Everything worked as expected. 400 Bad Request The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. 401 Unauthorized No valid API key provided. 402 Request Failed The parameters were valid but the request failed. 403 Forbidden The API key doesn’t have permissions to perform the request. 404 Not Found The requested resource doesn’t exist. 409 Conflict The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key). 429 Too Many Requests Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. 500, 502, 503, 504 Server Errors Something went wrong on Stripe’s end. (These are rare.) Error Types api _ error API errors cover any other type of problem (e.g., a temporary problem with Stripe’s servers), and are extremely uncommon. card _ error Card errors are the most common type of error you should expect to handle. They result when the user enters a card that can’t be charged for some reason. idempotency _ error Idempotency errors occur when an Idempotency-Key is re-used on a request that does not match the first request’s API endpoint and parameters. invalid _ request _ error Invalid request errors arise when your request has invalid parameters. Handling errors Our Client libraries raise exceptions for many reasons, such as a failed charge, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability. We recommend writing code that gracefully handles all possible API exceptions.

Expanding Responses Many objects allow you to request additional information as an expanded response by using the expand request parameter. This parameter is available on all API requests, and applies to the response of that request only. You can expand responses in two ways. In many cases, an object contains the ID of a related object in its response properties. For example, a Charge might have an associated Customer ID. You can expand these objects in line with the expand request parameter. The expandable label in this documentation indicates ID fields that you can expand into objects. Some available fields aren’t included in the responses by default, such as the number and cvc fields for the Issuing Card object. You can request these fields as an expanded response by using the expand request parameter. You can expand recursively by specifying nested fields after a dot ( . ). For example, requesting invoice. subscription on a charge expands the invoice property into a full Invoice object, then expands the subscription property on that invoice into a full Subscription object. You can use the expand parameter on any endpoint that returns expandable fields, including list, create, and update endpoints. Expansions on list requests start with the data property. For example, you can expand data. customers on a request to list charges and associated customers. Performing deep expansions on numerous list requests might result in slower processing times. Expansions have a maximum depth of four levels (for example, the deepest expansion allowed when listing charges is data. invoice. subscription. default_ source ). You can expand multiple objects at the same time by identifying multiple items in the expand array.

When creating or updating an object, use an idempotency key. Then, if a connection error occurs, you can safely repeat the request without risk of creating a second object or performing the update twice. To perform an idempotent request, provide an additional IdempotencyKey element to the request options. Stripe’s idempotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the first request made for any given idempotency key, regardless of whether it succeeds or fails. Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result, including 500 errors. A client generates an idempotency key, which is a unique key that the server uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request. How you create unique keys is up to you, but we suggest using V4 UUIDs, or another random string with enough entropy to avoid collisions. Idempotency keys are up to 255 characters long. You can remove keys from the system automatically after they’re at least 24 hours old. We generate a new request if a key is reused after the original is pruned. The idempotency layer compares incoming parameters to those of the original request and errors if they’re the same to prevent accidental misuse. We save results only after the execution of an endpoint begins. If incoming parameters fail validation, or the request conflicts with another request that’s executing concurrently, we don’t save the idempotent result because no API endpoint initiates the execution. You can retry these requests. Learn more about when you can retry idempotent requests . All POST requests accept idempotency keys. Don’t send idempotency keys in GET and DELETE requests because it has no effect. These requests are idempotent by definition.

You can use this parameter to attach key-value data to these Stripe objects. You can specify up to 50 keys, with key names up to 40 characters long and values up to 500 characters long. Keys and values are stored as strings and can contain any characters with one exception: you can’t use square brackets ([ and ]) in keys. You can use metadata to store additional, structured information on an object. For example, you could store your user’s full name and corresponding unique identifier from your system on a Stripe Customer object. Stripe doesn’t use metadata—for example, we don’t use it to authorize or decline a charge and it won’t be seen by your users unless you choose to show it to them. Some of the objects listed above also support a description parameter. You can use the description parameter to annotate a charge-for example, a human-readable description such as 2 shirts for test@example. com . Unlike metadata , description is a single string, which your users might see (for example, in email receipts Stripe sends on your behalf). Don’t store any sensitive information (bank account numbers, card details, and so on) as metadata or in the description parameter.

For example, you can list charges , list customers , and list invoices . These list API methods share a common structure and accept, at a minimum, the following three parameters: limit , starting_ after , and ending_ before . Stripe’s list API methods use cursor-based pagination through the starting_ after and ending_ before parameters. Both parameters accept an existing object ID value (see below) and return objects in reverse chronological order. The ending_ before parameter returns objects listed before the named object. The starting_ after parameter returns objects listed after the named object. These parameters are mutually exclusive. You can use either the starting_ after or ending_ before parameter, but not both simultaneously. Our client libraries offer auto-pagination helpers to traverse all pages of a list. Parameters limit optional, default is 10 This specifies a limit on the number of objects to return, ranging between 1 and 100. starting_ after optional object ID A cursor to use in pagination. starting_ after is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_ foo , your subsequent call can include starting_ after=obj_ foo to fetch the next page of the list. ending_ before optional object ID A cursor to use in pagination. ending_ before is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with obj_ bar , your subsequent call can include ending_ before=obj_ bar to fetch the previous page of the list. List Response Format object string, value is "list" A string that provides a description of the object type that returns. data array An array containing the actual response elements, paginated by any request parameters. has_ more boolean Whether or not there are more elements available after this set. If false , this set comprises the end of the list. url url The URL for accessing this list.

For example, you can search charges , search customers , and search subscriptions . Stripe’s search API methods utilize cursor-based pagination via the page request parameter and next_ page response parameter. For example, if you make a search request and receive "next_ page": "pagination_ key" in the response, your subsequent call can include page=pagination_ key to fetch the next page of results. Our client libraries offer auto-pagination helpers to easily traverse all pages of a search result. Search request format query required The search query string. See search query language . limit optional A limit on the number of objects returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10. page optional A cursor for pagination across multiple pages of results. Don’t include this parameter on the first call. Use the next_ page value returned in a previous response to request subsequent results. Search response format object string, value is "search_result" A string describing the object type returned. url string The URL for accessing this list. has_ more boolean Whether or not there are more elements available after this set. If false , this set comprises the end of the list. data array An array containing the actual response elements, paginated by any request parameters. next_ page string A cursor for use in pagination. If has_ more is true, you can pass the value of next_ page to a subsequent call to fetch the next page of results. total_ count optional positive integer or zero The total number of objects that match the query, only accurate up to 10,000. This field isn’t included by default. To include it in the response, expand the total_ count field. Response { " object " : " search_result " , " url " : " /v1/customers/search " , " has_more " : false , " data " : [ { " id " : " cus_4QFJOjw2pOmAGJ " , " object " : " customer " , " address " : null , " balance " : 0 , " created " : 1405641735 , " currency " : " usd " , " default_source " : " card_14HOpG2eZvKYlo2Cz4u5AJG5 " , " delinquent " : false , " description " : " someone@example.com for Coderwall " , " discount " : null , " email " : null , " invoice_prefix " : " 7D11B54 " , " invoice_settings " : { " custom_fields " : null , " default_payment_method " : null , " footer " : null , " rendering_options " : null }, " livemode " : false , " metadata " : { " foo " : " bar " }, " name " : " fakename " , " next_invoice_sequence " : 25 , " phone " : null , " preferred_locales " : [], " shipping " : null , " tax_exempt " : " none " , " test_clock " : null } ] } Auto-pagination Our libraries support auto-pagination.

Related guide: Disputes and fraud Endpoints POST / v1/ disputes/ :id GET / v1/ disputes/ :id GET / v1/ disputes POST / v1/ disputes/ :id/ close Show Events Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new Event object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a charge. succeeded event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an invoice. payment_ failed event. Certain API requests might create multiple events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, you receive both a customer. subscription. created event and a charge. succeeded event. Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event’s data field embeds the resource’s state at the time of the change. For example, a charge. succeeded event contains a charge, and an invoice. payment_ failed event contains an invoice. As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an individual event or a list of events from the API. We also have a separate webhooks system for sending the Event objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage webhooks in your account settings . Learn how to listen for events so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions. When using Connect , you can also receive event notifications that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there’s an additional account attribute in the received Event object. We only guarantee access to events through the Retrieve Event API for 30 days. Endpoints GET / v1/ events/ :id GET / v1/ events Show Events v2 Learn more about calling API v2 endpoints. Events are generated to keep you informed of activity in your business account. APIs in the /v2 namespace generate thin events which have small, unversioned payloads that include a reference to the ID of the object that has changed. The Events v2 API returns these new thin events. Retrieve the event object for additional data about the event. Use the related object ID in the event payload to fetch the API resource of the object associated with the event.

Endpoints GET / v1/ mandates/ :id Show Payment Intents A PaymentIntent guides you through the process of collecting a payment from your customer. We recommend that you create exactly one PaymentIntent for each order or customer session in your system. You can reference the PaymentIntent later to see the history of payment attempts for a particular session. A PaymentIntent transitions through multiple statuses throughout its lifetime as it interfaces with Stripe.js to perform authentication flows and ultimately creates at most one successful charge.

For example, you can use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer’s card without immediately collecting a payment. Later, you can use PaymentIntents to drive the payment flow. Create a SetupIntent when you’re ready to collect your customer’s payment credentials. Don’t maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents because they might not be valid. The SetupIntent transitions through multiple statuses as it guides you through the setup process. Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments. For example, cardholders in certain regions might need to be run through Strong Customer Authentication during payment method collection to streamline later off-session payments . If you use the SetupIntent with a Customer , it automatically attaches the resulting payment method to that Customer after successful setup. We recommend using SetupIntents or setup_future_usage on PaymentIntents to save payment methods to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods. By using SetupIntents, you can reduce friction for your customers, even as regulations change over time.

If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent. To learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides: Finalize payments on the server Build two-step confirmation . Endpoints GET / v1/ confirmation_tokens/ :id POST / v1/ test_helpers/ confirmation_tokens Show Tokens Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our recommended payments integrations to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way. If you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored. You can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create Customer objects or External accounts .

You can have multiple configurations with different sets of payment methods for different scenarios. There are two types of PaymentMethodConfigurations. Which is used depends on the charge type : Direct configurations apply to payments created on your account, including Connect destination charges, Connect separate charges and transfers, and payments not involving Connect. Child configurations apply to payments created on your connected accounts using direct charges, and charges with the on_behalf_of parameter. Child configurations have a parent that sets default values and controls which settings connected accounts may override. You can specify a parent ID at payment time, and Stripe will automatically resolve the connected account’s associated child configuration. Parent configurations are managed in the dashboard and are not available in this API.

Products help you track inventory or provisioning, and prices help you track payment terms. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by prices. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme. For example, you might have a single “gold” product that has prices for $10/month, $100/year, and €9 once.

A portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal. A portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.

They contain invoice items , and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary). If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment.  Note that finalizing the invoice, when automatic , does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice. If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your email settings , Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice. Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s minimum allowed charge per currency , the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice. More details on the customer’s credit balance are here .

An invoice item is added to an invoice by creating or updating it with an invoice field, at which point it will be included as an invoice line item within invoice.lines . Invoice Items can be created before you are ready to actually send the invoice. This can be particularly useful when combined with a subscription . Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually charge or credit the customer’s card only at the end of a regular billing cycle. This is useful for combining several charges (to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing totals.

Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define both the contents of the event’s payload and how to aggregate those events. Endpoints POST / v1/ billing/ meter_events Show Meter Events v2 Learn more about calling API v2 endpoints. Meter events are used to report customer usage of your product or service. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated. Meter events are processed asynchronously, so they may not be immediately reflected in aggregates or on upcoming invoices. Endpoints POST / v2/ billing/ meter_events Show Meter Event Adjustment A billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.

Endpoints POST / v2/ billing/ meter_event_adjustments Show Meter Event Stream v2 Learn more about calling API v2 endpoints. You can send a higher-throughput of meter events using meter event streams. For this flow, you must first create a meter event session, which will provide you with a session token. You can then create meter events through the meter event stream endpoint, using the session token for authentication. The session tokens are short-lived and you will need to create a new meter event session when the token expires. Endpoints POST / v2/ billing/ meter_event_session POST / v2/ billing/ meter_event_stream Show Meter Event Summary A billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period. Note: Meters events are aggregated asynchronously so the meter event summaries provide an eventually consistent view of the reported usage.

Endpoints GET / v1/ billing/ credit_balance_transactions/ :id GET / v1/ billing/ credit_balance_transactions Show Plans You can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the Prices API . It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration. Plans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. Products help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme. For example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year. Related guides: Set up a subscription and more about products and prices .
